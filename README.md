# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
Implemented a linked-list class using Java in Data Structures and Algorithms undergraduate course.
Allows the user to choose between 5 different options: Print, Insert, Remove, Clear, and Search.

In this program, I utilized Java to create a linked list to store integer values. It also gives the user various
menu options, with input error checking.
